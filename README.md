# Aeonian-Source
An unrestricted environment exploit for Roblox. Runs scripts at an identity of 6

This was the old Aeonian source that i am no longer working on due to how it is going to be superseded by Aeonian V4 which is an exploit that utilises a method of excecution called ProtoConversion founded by chirality in 2015, which is better and faster but at the same time harder

this is an exploit that utilises Autumns method of wrapping to achive execution on roblox
this exploit uses the same method of execution that other exploits use such as<br />
Cyber v1/2/3/ and possibly v4 idk there has been so many versions of cyber I lost track ages ago XD<br />
Axon v1 <br />
Flame V3 <br />
Bleu v1 <br />
WRDAPI Lua Execution (not the restricted one) (Oh wait that is axon ha) <br />

Old Exploits That Used The Same Method<br />
Terv<br />
Seraph<br />
Synapse (in its beta, also the predesecor to raindrop)<br />
Raindrop<br />

# What Features Does This Have?
. Functional Instance Caching<br />
. Non-Functional Table Caching That Would Work With A Bit Of Effort (Tables Will Still Wrap Normally)<br />
. Both-Way Yielding (Yields In Both Function Handlers)<br />
. Wraps All 11 Roblox Lua DataTypes *Including TPROTO TUPVALUE AND TNONE*<br />
. Stable<br />
. Has Lots Of Custom Functions<br />
. Easy Updating Procedure (Everything Is Neatly Laid Out And Does Not Require Any Hard-To-Find Addresses)<br />
. Fast Scanner (Credits To ASDF)<br />
. Very Modular And Easy To Expand Upon
. Has A Working Auth System (You Will Need To Rework It Though)<br />
. Has The Start Of A Script Obfuscation Function I Was Working On (Feel Free To Finish It)<br />
. Has 32Bit Support And Windows 7 Support<br />
. BETTER THAN AXON, SERIOUSLY IT IS LOL<br />


# Does This Work?
Yes, all you need to do is update the luastate, top&base, addresses and callingconventions and it should work perfectly!

# What is a Wrapper?
A wrapper is best explained by the creator of wrapping (Autumn) here:<br />

# Honourable Mentions

Anthony/Core - Teaching Me About Wrappers And Wrapping<br />
Autumn (Bless Her) Literally Taking Time Out Of Her Day To Teach Me Everything From Start To Finish Even Though She Quit The Exploit Community Years Ago, Huge Thanks To Her<br />
Cirmolddry - Uhh I Guess You Taught Me About Caching (In The Weirdest Way Possible)<br />

And Most Of All:<br />

Aero - Letting Axon Get Leaked<br />
If axon was never leaked i would have never met all these amazing people and i would have never gotten into roblox exploiting which is something i thoroughly enjoy to the max and it's something i do every day. So thanks for that aero i really appreciate it even if it wasn't supposed to be a good thing (which it wasn't) :P<br />
